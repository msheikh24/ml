## Statistical Review
* Bayes º theorem: 		P (H|X) = P(X|H) P (H) / P(X)
* binomial distribution:	It is used when there are exactly two mutually exclusive outcomes of a trial
* conditional probability	A probability computed under the assumption that some probability holds
* confidence intervals:	It is a range of values which we are fairly sure that true value lies in
* distribution:			How often each value appears
* estimation:				Data is used from sample to estimate characteristics of population.
* hypothesis testing:		To see aparant effects and evaluate wheather the effect is real.
* multinomial distribution:It is generalization of binomial distribution; Find probabilites in experiments where there are more than two outcomes
* non-parametric models:	A lot of data is available but no prior knowledge
* normal distribution:	Also called Gaussian and the bell curve
* probabilistic distribution:	A list of all the events of an experiment together with the probability associated with each event
* random variables:		It represents a process that generates a random number
* regression:				Describe relationships between variables
* variance:				It is intended to describe the spread
